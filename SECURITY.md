### 📢 Reporting a Vulnerability  
If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not disclose it publicly**. Instead, follow these steps:

1. **Email Security Team**: Report the issue privately via **[your email or security contact]**.
2. **Provide Details**: Include a clear description, reproduction steps, and potential impact.
3. **Response Time**: We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and provide an estimated resolution time.
4. **Responsible Disclosure**: Once fixed, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability and credit the reporter if they wish.

### 🔒 Security Best Practices  
To keep the project secure, we follow these guidelines:

- **Authentication & Authorization**:  
  - Use **bcrypt** for password hashing.
  - Implement **JWT** for secure token-based authentication.
  - Enforce **OAuth 2.0** for third-party authentication.

- **Data Protection**:  
  - All sensitive data is **encrypted** at rest and in transit (TLS/SSL).
  - Environment variables (`.env`) should **never** be committed to Git.

- **API Security**:  
  - Implement **rate limiting** to prevent abuse (e.g., brute-force attacks).
  - Validate and sanitize all user input to avoid **SQL injection & XSS attacks**.

- **Dependencies & Updates**:  
  - Regularly audit dependencies using `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
  - Use **dependabot** for automatic security updates.

### 🛡️ Security Tools Used  
- **Helmet.js** – Adds security headers to Express.js  
- **Rate Limiting** – Prevents API abuse  
- **CSRF Protection** – Ensures secure form submissions  
- **XSS Protection** – Prevents malicious scripts  

### ❌ Prohibited Actions  
- **Never** share API keys, passwords, or database credentials in public repositories.  
- **Do not** exploit security vulnerabilities in this project or its dependencies.
