Project Overview
This Next.js application serves as the frontend for our multi-service system, interfacing with the backend services to provide users with a dynamic and responsive interface. It leverages the power of React and Next.js to deliver server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side rendering as needed.

Features
Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Pre-renders pages on the server to improve performance and SEO.

Static Site Generation (SSG): Generates static HTML at build time for faster page loads.

API Routes: Provides backend functionality within the Next.js application.

CSS Modules & Sass Support: Enables modular and scoped styling using CSS and Sass.

Environment Variables: Manages configuration settings for different environments.
