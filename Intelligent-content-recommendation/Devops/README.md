# DevOps Repository

## Overview
This repository contains the necessary configurations and scripts for deploying and managing infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized applications.

## Getting Started

### 1. **CI/CD Pipelines**
- GitHub Actions workflows are located in `.github/workflows/`.
- Modify `backend-ci.yml`, `frontend-ci.yml`, and `ai-engine-ci.yml` as needed.

### 2. **Kubernetes Deployment**
- Apply the Kubernetes manifests using:
  ```sh
  kubectl apply -f k8s/
  ```
- Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster set up and `kubectl` configured.

### 3. **Terraform Infrastructure**
- Navigate to the `terraform/` directory and initialize:
  ```sh
  terraform init
  terraform apply
  ```
- Ensure you have Terraform installed and the correct provider configurations.

### 4. **Docker Usage**
- Build and run the containerized application:
  ```sh
  docker-compose up --build
  ```
- To build the Docker image manually:
  ```sh
  docker build -t my-app .
  ```

### 5. **Deployment Script**
- Execute `deploy.sh` to automate the deployment process:
  ```sh
  chmod +x deploy.sh
  ./deploy.sh
  ```

## Best Practices
- Use `.env` files for environment variables and avoid hardcoding sensitive data.
- Store Terraform state remotely for better team collaboration.
- Follow Git branching strategies (e.g., `main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `hotfix/*`).
- Regularly update dependencies and security patches.

## Contributing
- Fork the repository.
- Create a feature branch (`feature/my-update`).
- Commit your changes and push them.
- Open a pull request for review.
